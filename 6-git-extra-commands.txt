git checkout <branchname or commithash>   ->> we can checkout to a previosuly do commit by using checkout 

and when we checkout to a particular commit, head points  to that commit rather than branchpointer this is called detech head

if we are on a particular branch and wantto move on the latest commit then
we use 

git switch <branchname>  

we can use
git checkout HEAD~1
this means head-1 refers to the one commit before head 


git checkout HEAD <flename> || git checkout -- <flename>   -->>this works well
git restore <filename>  || git restore --source HEAD~3 <filename1,filename2>  -> 

this is a new command we can use it to restore that we do with the above command
and also we can restore our file over specific to previous commits .

by the abvoe command -> suppose we made some changes on a file but don;t want to keep them 
to revert the file back to whatever it is used when you lat committed,you can.use



############################################# restore staged changes##################################33

suppose we add some files but we did't wantto push or commit them,so we can use 

git restore --staged <filename>



######################### restore commits ######################


suppose we made a couple of commits on a branch and now we realize we haveto commit them on a different branch so
we use

git reset <commit-hash> 

this command remove extra comments and now we are on <commit-hash> but we did't loseour code,
our code is in workingdirectory at that point we we cut a new branch and came back to main after switch then we foundour code


if we want to remove commits and the actualchanges in our file
the 

git reset --hard<commit-hash>

############################## another technique to revert################################33333

sreset changes the pointer header to specific commit it can cause conflictif we workingwith team some other
member have some commit

git reverts <commit hash> --> it  erase the work from the hashwd commit and add a new commit with previous work and now head 
points to latest commit and we have work of commetedhash
