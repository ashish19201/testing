in this we learn to merge with fast->fordward merging technique

step-1-> we have to go to the receiving branch

git merge <branchname>


there is a recursive approach also 

suppose on master we have do 2 commits  and in another we also do 2 commits both 2 commits are unkonown to other branch then if we do
git merge <branchname>   -> then anew commit automatically add to the receiving branch by  the git and merging take  place
