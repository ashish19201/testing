if we are on a branch and switch b/w the two branches the we have to either commit the resilt or we have to stash the changes

there hapeen two possible scenarios 
1->the changes reflect on the main branch(main->where we are going to switch)
2->git stops us and tell please commit the result


git stash     -->stash them locally  on working copy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git stash pop
git staash apply --> use these  commands to adding bace
git stash list -> to list all the stashes in the directory
git stash drop 0   -> to drop or delete a stash from the stashed directory

Remember and note that stash move and keep changes only of staged files not the newly create file that is only in working directory

################# here are new changes#######
let stash them and add them
