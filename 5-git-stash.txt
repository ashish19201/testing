if we are on a branch and switch b/w the two branches the we have to either commit the resilt or we have to stash the changes

there hapeen two possible scenarios 
1->the changes reflect on the main branch(main->where we are going to switch)
2->git stops us and tell please commit the result


git stash     -->stash them locally  on working copy
